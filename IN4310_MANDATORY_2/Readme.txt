The files are named after which exercise they belong to, except for exercise 1 which is just the default name.
cocoSource_xcnnfused_3.py contains full implementations of task 1 and 2 as well, so you do not need to go through each and 
every version.

Exercise_Train_an_image_captioning_network_val.py is the validation file, which uses the best model from task 2 (model_1) to do a 
validation and make 5 captioning images.
